\section{Dataset}

The dataset used for this project was a competition dataset from Hugging Face, held in 2023 \cite{huggingface_competitions_aiornot}.
The dataset consists of 62,060 images, and is 2.37GB in size, being pre-split into training and tesing sets, as summarised in \cref{tab:dataset_summary,tab:class_counts}, where it can be seen that the testing set has the class labels withheld due to the competition setting, restricting this analysis to the 18,618 training images, which we can sub-divide and validate with known labels.
